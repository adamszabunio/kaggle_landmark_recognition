# kaggle_landmark_recognition

### To pass some time in between interviews, thought I would compete in my first Kaggle competition:
### [The Google Landmark Recognition Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/landmark-recognition-challenge) 

- The main purpose of this repo is to be used as a refresher of deep learning topics.

- This Kaggle competiton uses over one million (1,225,029) training images of popular landmarks, such as the Colosseum in Rome, Italy:

- From just these 4 images above, you can see how this will be a challenge to classify all of these images as "Colosseum"

- However, an even larger challenge is the uneven distrbution of the Landmarks:
    + From [initial EDA](eda_training_data.ipynb) we found there are â‰ˆ15K unique Landmarks in our training set of 1.2 million images.
    + Nearly 44% of the Landmarks have at most 10 images.
    + Furthermore, 20 of the most frequent Landmarks contain one-third of the training images!
